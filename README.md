# stochasticMethodsProject

Repository made for project required in Stochastic Methods in Machine Learning course in AGH UST.

Project's main goal is to compare different types of generative models and show that comparison by creating simple *Turing test*.
The test is constructed as decribed below:
- show image - generated by models or original one (from dataset) - to human being
- human being chooses only one from two answers - *real* or *generated*
- repeat first two steps few times
- analize human responses

If the generative models are good enough, they should be able to generate images that can deceive human being and be labaled as *real* ones in the test.
